# You made a guest appearance in a Canadian TV show, and you got paid 250 Canadian dollars! Sweet! Wait, is that a lot?

# Let's create a function called cnd_to_usd() that converts currency from Canadian dollars to US dollars
# 1 Canadian dollar = 0.80 United States dollars

# STEP 1: DEFINE A FUNCTION
# Fill in the necessary code below to create the function

cnd_to_usd <- function(cnd_amount) {
  
  us_value <- .8 * cnd_amount
  us_value
}

# STEP 2: USE AND TEST THE FUNCTION
# Save this variable
my_canadian_payout <- 250

# Run the function and save the value in this variable
usd_payout <- cnd_to_usd(my_canadian_payout)

# Print out the value
print(usd_payout)

# What happens if we try to print out the following variables?
print(cnd_amount)
print(us_payout)
# Do you see these variables in the global environment grid to the right? Why or why not? What does that mean?

# More Conditionals Practice

coffee_price <- 5
my_money <- 5

# Write an if/else conditional that will print "You can buy coffee" if there's enough money to buy coffee, or another message if there's not enough money
if(my_money >= coffee_price) {
  print("You can buy coffee!")
} else {
  print("You can't buy coffee, sorry!")
}
  
# Now change my_money to 2, and test the function again

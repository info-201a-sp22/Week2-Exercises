# Conditionals Practice

# Let's build a conditional that will report whether the temperature in an office needs to be adjusted.
# This program will measure the temperature of an office and then report whether the temperature is “too hot”, “too cold,” or “ideal.”

# With your group, decide on an ideal temperature for an office. Then come up with a temperature for the imaginary office that we’re testing. Assign these values to the following variables.
office_temperature <-
ideal_temperature <-


# Write a conditional that will report whether office_temperature is “too hot,” “too cold,” or “ideal”
if(conditional here) {
  print("You can buy coffee!")
} else if ...


# Now change the value of the office_temperature, and test the conditional again to make sure it works
